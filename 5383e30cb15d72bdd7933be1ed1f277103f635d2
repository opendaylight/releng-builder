      "message": "this is the main thing with this pattern, it requires this inlining to be done for each function. Why not just source the common-functions.sh one time and then call the functions as expected. This is the real difference between the two patches - everything else is pretty much the same. That and the calling of the functions is more intuitive with sourcing - with sourcing you don\u0027t need to remember to inline when using a HERE doc.",
