      "message": "Luis, will this work?  I didn\u0027t know the answer so asked Venkat to just give us a patch to talk about it.  the problem is that netvirt has two impls.  (legacy and default).  we already have a patch-test yaml for the default impl.  we want another one for legacy.  but, the only way to differentiate is with project name.  if we use netvirt-legacy here, will it break anything or will it just mean the gerrit keyword is \"test-netvirt-legacy\"?",
