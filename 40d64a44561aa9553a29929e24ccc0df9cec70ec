      "message": "I wonder if most projects would be fine with a v2-standard-1 ? That would be 1 core with 4gb memory. I think all the projects which really need multicore should be switching to the v2-highcpu flavors already.\n\nThe v2-standard-2 is cheaper than the v2-highcpu-4 so if the projects don\u0027t need the cpus might as well stay with the cheaper option.",
