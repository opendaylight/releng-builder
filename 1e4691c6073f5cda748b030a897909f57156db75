Why should the password be stored base64 encoded, it\u0027s already in a secure enclave and doing and echo like that could potentially lead to a leaked password in the GHA logs.\n\nThe upstream action should be fixed to _not_ need a base64 encoded password unless there is a clear reason why it should meaning that this change should not be needed.",
