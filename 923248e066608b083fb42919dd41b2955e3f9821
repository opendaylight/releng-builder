      "message": "this name is not used in the job name. the job name is\nderived from the template below on line 79.\n\nthe problem is from the email [0] for netvirt to try and\nreduce the frequency of some of the jobs. Alon\u0027s thought\nwas just to have stateful/nodlv2 run every 4 hours, not\n*every* stateful job. So, I broke it out in to it\u0027s\nown project.\n\nstill, nodlv2 is still up in the main project above, but\nit has no 4 hour timer. That will still trigger the same\njobs this project is creating, but only nightly (5 times\na week). the other project is also where 3node stayed.\n\nin the end we\u0027d get 4 times a day PLUS nightly for this\n1node nodlv2 stateful job. this will be our only job to\ngive us high frequency for better regression detection.",
