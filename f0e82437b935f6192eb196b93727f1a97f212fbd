To do this, create a YAML file in your project\u0027s sub-directory\nwith any name other than \u003cproject\u003e.yaml. The auto-update script will only\nsearch for files with the name \u003cproject\u003e.yaml. The normal \u003cproject\u003e.yaml file\ncan then be left in tact with the \"# REMOVE THIS LINE IF...\" comment so it will\nbe automatically updated.",
