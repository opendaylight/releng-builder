It\u0027s the responsibility of the scripts to make sure the directory is available to them when they need it.",

      "message": "I disagree. If mkdir fails when directory exists then it is not passing \u0027-p\u0027 as it should be passing. \"mkdir -p\" will not fail, anytime we call mkdir we should be passing \u0027-p\u0027.\n\nThe intent of the feature of $WORKSPACE/archives when I designed it was that you can create it at any point in time because during a build job you might want to archive things off without using $ARCHIVE_ARTIFACTS pattern based approach.\n\nThe problem with a pattern based approach is it\u0027s inaccurate and copying things to archives directory is a much better method if you know exactly what you need to archive.",
