I think this job name is far too longer anyway, we should use something much shorter for the name like:\n\n builder-find-consecutive-job-fails\n\nYou can move the full text \"Find jenkins jobs with consecutive failures\" to the \"description\" field however.\n\n(All our jobs should have a prefix of the project that is maintaining the job. I used builder here as an example but we should probably pick one based on which team is expected to maintain this job.)",
