I guess we don\u0027t have builds going there yet?\n\nhttps://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight-fluorine-ubuntu-1604-x86_64-devel/\n\nI think I told you this should trigger based on changes to path to packaging logic, but actually those are the jobs with verify in the name. This one, and the RPM one it parallels, isn\u0027t actually triggered that much. It\u0027s just used for manually testing a package now I think.\n\nSince this isn\u0027t going to be triggered in any automated way, I guess just having the most recent version available as the default is okay for now. Nitrogen SR2 (this repo) is currently that. Once we have CD for debs working we can update this to point to those repos.",
