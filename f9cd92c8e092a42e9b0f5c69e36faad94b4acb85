      "message": "why can\u0027t you make it as apt/yum repositories for having quagga and its source packages ? This would simplify installers just to depend on package names (like thrift, zmq, c-capnproto, quagga and zrpc) without worrying too much on constructing relative paths with different versions ?\n\nThis will be also useful for ansible-opendaylight role (https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/66195/) for consuming quagga packages seamlessly just with corresponding quagga repo URLs.",

      "message": "@Periyasamy: Can you confirm how many packages are created from build this quagga build? IMU totally requires about 6 packages * 2 (debs/rpms) which requires hosting and maintaining around 12 repositories. \n\nIt may not feasible to build and maintain several repositories for each external dependency on ODL Nexus since the releases are independent of ODL and the projects are not maintained by LF, note: each repo requires additional schedule tasks and jobs for metadata generation etc.. \n\nWe can still upload them as hosted repositories since its easy to pull them the .rpm/.deb with a simple curl/wget into the project builders/scripts files.",
