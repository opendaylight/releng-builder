This would simplify installers just to depend on package names (like thrift, zmq, c-capnproto, quagga and zrpc) without worrying too much on constructing relative paths with different versions ?\n\nThis will be also useful for ansible-opendaylight role (https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/66195/) for consuming quagga packages seamlessly just with corresponding quagga repo URLs.",
