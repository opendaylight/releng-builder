      "message": "why can\u0027t you make it as apt/yum repositories for having quagga and its source packages ? This would simplify installers just to depend on package names (like thrift, zmq, c-capnproto, quagga and zrpc) without worrying too much on constructing relative paths with different versions ?\n\nThis will be also useful for ansible-opendaylight role (https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/66195/) for consuming quagga packages seamlessly just with corresponding quagga repo URLs.",

      "message": "@Periyasamy: Can you confirm how many packages are created from build this quagga build? IMU totally requires about 6 packages * 2 (debs/rpms) which requires hosting and maintaining around 12 repositories. \n\nIt may not feasible to build and maintain several repositories for each external dependency on ODL Nexus since the releases are independent of ODL and the projects are not maintained by LF, note: each repo requires additional schedule tasks and jobs for metadata generation etc.. \n\nWe can still upload them as hosted repositories since its easy to pull them the .rpm/.deb with a simple curl/wget into the project builders/scripts files.",

      "message": "Anil, Yes, there are 6 packages created with quagga build. But it doesn\u0027t need one repo/package. we just need 2 repositories (for apt and yum).  \n\nOn my local setup, I just run dpkg-scanpackages (or) createrepo commands to create apt/yum repositories accordingly with quagga packages and i guess it can be directly uploaded into nexus. \nso can\u0027t we make these relavant changes in this script ?\n\nI think it has following advantages.\n\n1. package dependencies are resolved automatically while installing quagga packages by apt-get install (or) yum install\n2. The quagga installer script will look clean and easily maintainable (we can avoid lot version hardcoding, etc. in https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/65245/7/jjb/integration/quagga-install.sh)\n3. The ansible-opendaylight role can just use ansible package module to install these packages irrespective of any distribution which looks cleaner way of installing things.\n\nI understand this repo should be maintained by 6wind and ODL, OPNFV can make use of it. Philippe can comment on it.",

      "message": "Ideally, these packages should get into centos/debian/ubuntu upstream (to get it packaged there), doing that sort of work makes stuff available to a larger audience which benefits the community largely. It\u0027s may not be possible for ODL to become a distribution point for third-party code. We do our own packaging of ODL since we\u0027re the official upstream for ODL. \nIf for some reason those distros won\u0027t take the work, then possibly work with one of the \"standard\" third-party repo providers to get it hosted out of there.",
