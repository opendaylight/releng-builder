Similarly to what integration-distribution-test-{stream} does.\n\nThe point is that Sandbox users would not need the triggering job there, so no job would be started on Sandbox by cron.\n\nThe triggering job should have \u0027weekly\u0027 in its name (instead of \u0027longevity\u0027) and start over weekend (for example Saturday 20:00 UTC).",
