During testing, I had this same line BEFORE the modprobe. \n\nThe job would fail, non-zero return from script, because openvswitch module was not loaded.\n\nSo, as is, the script will exit with non-zero, and the job will fail, if the openvswitch module is not loaded.",

Now, I needed a place to also do a modprobe of the kernel. This was a nice fit, but since the script is now doing more than just setting controller ip, I wanted the name to reflect that. \n\nAnd, the kernel module modprobe is for the VM itself, not the controller.",
