      "message": "Sam,\nThis was a temporary workaround until networking-l2gw patches were merged upstream, which they have been in master (which was queens, until few days back). So, I have already pushed a patch (and merged) that removed this private repo.\n\nBut, the networking-l2gw patches are not in stable/queens, have cherry-picked them to stable/queens, hoping they will go in maybe next day or two or three, as they only affect devstack deployments. If they don\u0027t go in soon, I will probably push another patch to use private repo until they get merged, so that ODL l2gw queens csit jobs will run.",
