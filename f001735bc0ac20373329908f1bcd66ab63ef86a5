      "message": "I\u0027m concerned by this. We had a hard time getting docker to not mess with our network routing on CentOS (which it does by default). What guarantees can you give me that this does _not_ setup a default network, or more precisely, how are you going to force it to use the default network we\u0027ve got defined in our RelEng managed docker image?",

But what I\u0027m saying is that I can\u0027t let this merge until it\u0027s shown that it will either not bring up a localized docker bridge or that the bridge that it brings up will be forced to 10.250.0.254/24 which is what we\u0027ve defined as the subnet for docker to utilize in the CI environment.\n\nSee https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p\u003dreleng/builder.git;a\u003dblob;f\u003dvagrant/docker/bootstrap.sh;h\u003debafa994f23555aaf444e2e3a29a32c4653514c7;hb\u003dHEAD#l20 for how we force it on RedHat systems.
