      "message": "Guillaume: This is a perfect example of \"scope creep\", where change is being forced to do something that\u0027s not relevent or required to be addressed the change in question. \n\nI\u0027d rather recommend creating a separate issue and submitting a separate change to move to dash (bin/sh) and POSIX compliance. Note: its hard to capture what/why things happened from the comment history rather than the commit history. It also makes it hard to revert changes in case something is not working.",
