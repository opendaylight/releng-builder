      "message": "Guillaume: This is a perfect example of \"scope creep\", where change is being forced to do something that\u0027s not relevent or required to be addressed the change in question. \n\nI\u0027d rather recommend creating a separate issue and submitting a separate change to move to dash (bin/sh) and POSIX compliance. Note: its hard to capture what/why things happened from the comment history rather than the commit history. It also makes it hard to revert changes in case something is not working.",

      "message": "Anil: Thanks for addressing my comments.\nMy vote -1 was mainly because of the commit message content indeed.\nI suggested using dot instead of source to be more coherent with the merge of 102082 and because I consider it as a best practice.\nI agree that it does not change anything functionally and that bashisms removal was not planned initially.\nThough, the difference between \"scope creep\" and \"technical debt\" is just a matter of standpoint. I consider portability very important.\nThough, with the current situation and the bound to LFN global-jjb, it is difficult to forecast side-effects and I am fine to consider bashisms removal more as a long-term goal.\nIt would be good if we can have a dedicated meeting to discuss about our different goals and the best strategy to adopt.",
