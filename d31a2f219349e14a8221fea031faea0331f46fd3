The bug is not severe, so netconfready does not need to fail on it if a workaround exists.\n\nIn my testing, retrying KarafKeywords.Open_Controller_Karaf_Console_On_Background once helps. But in current state when the userfeatures job may fail without reporting, the job is not stable enough for inclusion to csit-list.",
