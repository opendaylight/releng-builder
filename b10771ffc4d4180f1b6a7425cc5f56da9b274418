The difference is that when BUNDLE_URL is set to \"last\", we set ACTUAL_BUNDLE_URL to the most recent zip file (of the given stream) present in Nexus.\n(If there is a Robot test to run, it gets that actual value as BUNDLE_URL Robot variable.)\n\nThis is neither. Perhaps BUNDLE_PATH would be a better name?",
