      "message": "Currently the topic build covers all MSI projects, this means as far as I understand this patch will only work in the scenario someone wants to build MRI projects (odlparent, yangtools) before the topic build and/or build Self Managed projects after the topic build. If this is the intention I would recommend to clarify this in the commit message as well as in the docs: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p\u003dreleng/builder.git;a\u003dblob;f\u003ddocs/jenkins.rst;h\u003d25e5370f922310a886152e8906f3009194590286;hb\u003dHEAD#l793",
