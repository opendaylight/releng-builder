I know that\u0027s\npie-in-the-sky :)\n\nanyway, since these are duplicates for all of these\nbranches, can you just pop it out of the stream: \nsection to make it just a single variable to be used\nlike you already are in line 268 below?",

      "message": "It is separated on purpose, I am not sure what we want to build/test for oxygen or nitrogen branches so I simply copied from fluorine for now but that may not be totally correct (e.g. SR project list is probably more accurate). Also for future releases we will have to update the build-order list with the managed projects list.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t really fully understand this magic shell script code to be able to properly review it, but you could compare the PATCHES_TO_BUILD this produces, for a couple of topics, against what you get as output on http://opendaylight-bot-opendaylight-bot.6923.rh-us-east-1.openshiftapps.com (email me if unclear to use) and see if they match completely?  I think such a diff would be very interesting and useful.  Does this also \"remove leading projects which have no changes\" like I do in https://github.com/vorburger/opendaylight-bot/blob/master/bot/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/bot/odl/MultipatchJob.java ?  So e.g. if you build topic:binding-tlc-getkey, then it has to NOT build infrautils, but it HAS to build all projects after mdsal, EVEN if they don\u0027t have changes yet... did you take that into account?",
