A footer is the final block of text in a commit message so leaving a space between this and Change-Id below effectively makes this part of the Body of the commit and not the footer. Git analysis tools that parse footers will typically ignore the body.",

The last block of text that up until a blank line is considered a metadata footer in a lot of git tools.\n\nThis is why if you\u0027ve ever amended a commit and accidentally put a blank line between Change-Id and Signed-off-by you\u0027ll notice that Gerrit will assign you a new Change-Id field and assume it\u0027s a new patch rather than the same patch.",
