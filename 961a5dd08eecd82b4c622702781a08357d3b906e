      "message": "Not sure if we want to do this via vagrant-opendaylight or not. Definitely an option, but could also install ansible-opendaylight via direct call to `ansible-galaxy` (vs using requirements.yml via cloned repo). Would then need to create a playbook and invoke ansible-odl to install ODL with it. Really not sure what the best route is. Kinda nice to have pristine, isolated VM for ODL install, but kinda nice to not stand up an additional VM.",

      "message": "Okay, thanks. PR is merged. You\u0027ll need to clone the ansible repo to run linting and other tests, so good to have an example requirements.yml there already. Can refactor this to clone ansible-opendaylight, install the role and install ODL. Also would be good to run linting via tox. Will need to change the venv name and install into it via ansible-opendaylight/requirements.txt. This feedback applies to the RPM as well.",
