      "message": "Distribution-check does not have the same file system layout as the other jobs. It checks out vtn to $WORKSPACE/vtn because the job also clones integration/distribution.\n\nAnyway I think it\u0027s not important to archive VTN artifacts in distribution-check. The job\u0027s purpose is not to archive things but to quickly run a few tests and detect distribution issues. If you need to archive things that should be done in the verify job.",
