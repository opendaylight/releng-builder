I use\n\n    xmlstarlet ed -P -N mvn\u003dhttp://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 -u //mvn:version[../mvn:groupId\u003d\\\"org.opendaylight.${project}\\\"] -v ${target} ${file} \u003e ${file}.new\n    mv ${file}.new ${file}\n\n(${file} is the file to process, ${project} the project whose version we want to change, and ${target} the version we want to use).\n\nThat only deals with a single version for all the artifacts of a given project, which will fail for MD-SAL dependencies IIRC. It is possible to determine the correct version to use for any dependency, given a Maven tree, but it takes a *long* time (we need to calculate the effective POM of the root module, process that, and recurse for all modules discovered; calculating large numbers of effective POMs takes a while).",
