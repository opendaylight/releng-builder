      "message": "We\u0027ll run into trouble here if the same snapshot version ends up being used in two different projects (released or otherwise). I use\n\n    xmlstarlet ed -P -N mvn\u003dhttp://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 -u //mvn:version[../mvn:groupId\u003d\\\"org.opendaylight.${project}\\\"] -v ${target} ${file} \u003e ${file}.new\n    mv ${file}.new ${file}\n\n(${file} is the file to process, ${project} the project whose version we want to change, and ${target} the version we want to use).\n\nThat only deals with a single version for all the artifacts of a given project, which will fail for MD-SAL dependencies IIRC. It is possible to determine the correct version to use for any dependency, given a Maven tree, but it takes a *long* time (we need to calculate the effective POM of the root module, process that, and recurse for all modules discovered; calculating large numbers of effective POMs takes a while).",

      "message": "It would fail to hand-provided versions of yangtools, too. That\u0027s why we use $project-artifacts to propagate versions -- meaning there is one version to rule them all. That is true for odlparent, yangtools, mdsal -- and will need to happen to for other projects as they become MRI.",

      "message": "It makes sense to use $project-artifacts to hide all the different versions within a project but for mdsal some MSI projects are using at least 2 versions of the same project (e.g. binding-parent and artifacts). This complicates the version adjustment in mdsal project as Stephen points outs.",
