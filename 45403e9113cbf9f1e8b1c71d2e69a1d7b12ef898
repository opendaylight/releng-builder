I\u0027m thinking some projects may have very little \nactivity, meaning few merge jobs happening. But, they\u0027ll want some periodic history (assuming they care)\nin case some downstream breaks them.",

      "message": "these are the unmanaged projects.\n\none thing that\u0027s going to happen is that I will be\ndisabling CSIT (schedule of \u0027\u0027) for all unmanaged\nprojects, unless they opt in via email (coming\nsoon)\n\nSo, we can assume that projects that still want\nCSIT, are those that actually care about it and\nintend to use it for something. USC is one of\nthose, as An asked me to make sure I don\u0027t disable\nUSC (and NEMO) CSIT.\n\nFor those projects, they *might* be in maintenance\nmode and rarely doing merges. So, if we trigger\noff merge jobs, I fear their CSIT will rarely\nrun. The risk there is that some downstream (e.g.\nmdsal) breaks them and we don\u0027t find out for\nmonths.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s not worth the worry?\n\nCould we have a merge job trigger AND a weekly?",
