      "message": "Since pre-commit is enforced in the CI and this change bumps version and excludes common-packer from the checks performed,\nI consider it modifies the CI configuration and behavior.\nSo I think \"CI\" was more adapted than \"Chore\" according to the commonly accepted standard.\n\nHowever, since neither conventional comits official pages nor ODL/releng documentations define clearly what \"CI\" and \"Chore\" types mean, there can be diverging interpretations here.\n\nhttps://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ only defines the \"feat\" and \"fix\" types. It lets the possibilities open for any other types and gives https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum \nand https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type as examples.\nOnly angular proposes a definition of its types in its documentation\nI quote \n\"ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)\"\n\nAnd there is no  definiton given for the \"chore\" type.\n\nSo here are Karma definition for \"test\"(\u003d~ CI) and \"chore\"\n\"\n test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)\n chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)\n\"\nhttp://karma-runner.github.io/6.3/dev/git-commit-msg.html\n\nBoth induce no production code change.",
