      "message": "Commit messages should be written in present-tense, imperative-style. Something like:\n\n Remove \"-v ODL_VERSION:${ODL_STREAM}\" option from csit jobs\n \n Also include a detailed description of why this is being removed\n would be handy.\n\nIs it being removed because it is no longer necessary? Why is it no longer necessary? Did something change that made it unnecessary?\n\nThis helps the reviewer (and in the future potential debugger) understand why this patch was necessary.\n\nI usually share this blog post as I find it pretty descriptive of why formatting the commit message properly is useful.\n\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/",
