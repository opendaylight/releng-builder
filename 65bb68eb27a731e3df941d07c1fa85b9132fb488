Commenting on another project change for stable/nitrogen branch (and adding a link from my odlparent change) is usable enough.\n\nMultipatch job without -{stream} would still need to know the desired distribution branch. We could introduce trigger words such as multipatch-build-nitrogen. But in the future we could wish to add some fast sanity csit tests, so keeping -{stream} makes more sense for me.",
