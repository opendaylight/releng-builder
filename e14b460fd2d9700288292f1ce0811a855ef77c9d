The differences are not just the build tag.\n\nThough I\u0027d really like it if these build scripts didn\u0027t have to be able to build not only the current version but all prior versions as well.  Prior version builds should be generated by prior versions of the build scripts; what\u0027s currently here is a pretty painful workaround.",
