We should think hard about what we want to keep in Jenkins because archives in Jenkins slow down Jenkins so we want to keep this to a minimum where possible.",

We can pull builds and re-push to build servers like Suse/CBS, where builds will be kept longer. Can look at hosting release packages in ODL infra longer later.",
