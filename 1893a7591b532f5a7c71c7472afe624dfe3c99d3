      "message": "Yes, I get your point, that their should be an installation with the default variables. So their should be tests covering default installation as well as overridden configuration.\n\nBut customization can only be done by overriding these variables in the tasks playbook, \"configure_odl_logs.yml\". Tests are only asserting the expected behavior. They won\u0027t override the configuration if we provide them with these variables. If we want that, it would mean repeating the tasks in the above playbook again in the tests.\n\nSo rather I think that there should be separate jobs, one for testing the default configuration, and another one that should test the other aspects.\n\nDon\u0027t know if it makes sense!",

      "message": "Ah, yes, I think I understand what you\u0027re saying. I assumed we were already re-applying config before running tests, but it looks like we actually are not.\n\nI was imagining that each builder script would have two Ansible calls:\n\n* Provision/re-provision ODL overriding params to tweak config knobs. \n* Run the relevant tests to verify config knobs.\n\nI\u0027d like to avoid creating many individual jobs because I think that would consume more infra resources and add to the already somewhat difficult to manage large number of jobs. These different config knob provision/test steps are suites in one job, imho.",
