Removing stable- from all streams would make this less confusing however I\u0027d rather not rename every job in JJB, plus as we stop supporting older releases this format will be phased out anyway so letting time take care of this isn\u0027t too bad.\n\nIf we do want to remove the stable- part from the stream for consistency we could do it as a separate later patch. (Just wanted to through my thought out there, not action needs to be done here.)",
