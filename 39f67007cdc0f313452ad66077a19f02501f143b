      "message": "I\u0027m undecided about the stable- part. Removing stable- from all streams would make this less confusing however I\u0027d rather not rename every job in JJB, plus as we stop supporting older releases this format will be phased out anyway so letting time take care of this isn\u0027t too bad.\n\nIf we do want to remove the stable- part from the stream for consistency we could do it as a separate later patch. (Just wanted to through my thought out there, not action needs to be done here.)",

      "message": "I don\u0027t like the idea of having this list. It means we\u0027d have to keep this list updated which I think we shouldn\u0027t need to. I\u0027d prefer to have the Handle Streams code figure out automatically what the branch mapping is based on the name of the stream. Probably safe to assume that the first listed stream will be master and any stream listed after the first will have a branch with the same name.\n\nIn the case of streams that start with \"stable-\", for backwards compatibility we can have code to remove the \"stable-\" part and assume the remainder is the branch.\n\nThoughts?",
