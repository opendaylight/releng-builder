      "message": "Happy new year everyone.\n\n@Anil and Andrew LGTM as far as I can see but -1 because of a few  commit messages issues.\n\nAlso I\u0027ve added a few remarks to improve the portability only in the first script and I encourage you to consider them everywhere here.\nEven if I won\u0027t block you for that or if you want to stick with bash for the moment.\n\nAlthough bash is a good interactive shell, I am no fond of using it for such scripting\nlike most GNU/linux distros now.(cf https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh and https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Bashism)\n\nHope this helps\nGuillaume\n\n",
