      "message": "This change is fine as long as we\u0027re running verify for a single java-version however the reason it\u0027s explicitly listed for verify-jobs is because sometimes projects want to test against more than 1 java-version.\n\nverify jobs is the only job-template that accepts a list of java-versions too so if we put the list outside of verify-jobs it will break other jobs.",

      "message": "With the current JDK cadence, we can fully expect multi-JDK verifies being the norm at least in platform projects -- the math boils down to upgrading JDK every 18 months:\n- we will ship Mg with JDK11, but by that time JDK14 (LTS) will be available\n- provided we let it soak soak for 12 months, we will be upgrading to JDK14 in 18 months\n\nNote that the 8-\u003e11 experience has shown that having knowledge of individual breakages (8-\u003e9, 9-\u003e10, 10-\u003e11) is beneficial.",
