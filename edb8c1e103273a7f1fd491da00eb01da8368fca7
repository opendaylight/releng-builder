      "message": "sudo pip install should never be used together imo as it really does break system level packages.\n\nHmm.... another idea I have is to use the user flag. How about you try this:\n\n pip3 install --user \u003cpython-3-packages\u003e\n\nThis way it will install python 3 stuff to ~/.local/share/python instead of the system level.\n\nEffectively it should work similar to system level install packages but without having to `sudo pip install` stuff.",
