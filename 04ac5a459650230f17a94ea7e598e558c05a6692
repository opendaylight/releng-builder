      "message": "this is where we are serially installing and bringing up each controller which is taking the normal time + 60s as seen above.  I wonder if we can modify the above code so that it just starts karaf on each controller, then add another for loop to poll on restconf/modules which should happen pretty quickly in succession.  finally, if that sleep 60 has a good reason for existing, it can just happen once after the 3rd controller is up.\n\nI hope that made sense.  it does in my mind :)",
