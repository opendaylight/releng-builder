      "message": "Cool. I think we need to somehow communicate to the community the difference between recheck and reverify. I suspect there will be confusion otherwise as most folks think reverify is equivalent to recheck.\n\nAlternative is to pick another word for reverify and leave reverify to continue being the same meaning. This might also be confusing though so maybe spending some cycles informing projects about recheck vs reverify will be worth the effort in the long run.",
