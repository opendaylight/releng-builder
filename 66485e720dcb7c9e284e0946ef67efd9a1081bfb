Note: you\u0027ll likely need to add this job def for each of the stream/branch in odlparent.\n\nComing to the second part, the release merge template is a part of the global-jjb release-jobs template that takes 4 required params, and does not include the git-tag, version or gerrit-branch which are newer ones introduced here. If we need these to be usable then we\u0027ll need to modify the global-jjb template to accomodate these values, without impacting the workflow for other LF projects. :)",

      "message": "okay, so git-tag et al. is something which should translate to GIT_TAG parameter in the release job. Most notably we want to pre-fill GERRIT_BRANCH, plus provide guidance as to what the stage job/release name should be.\n\nyeah, I am starting with master, as that is simplest -- for stable streams, we want to also define VERSION and VERSION_TAG to 12.0.XXX.\n\nAll of this is for humans, really, so the sooner we have push-button end-to-end project releases, this will become moot.\n\nSo, I guess global-jjb will need to grow a {stream} template parameter first, at which point we can rebase.",
