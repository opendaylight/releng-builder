      "message": "Victor, the commit message body is not for logging the history of a patchset review. This is what Gerrit is for! and if someone needs that detail they can use the Change-Id field to correlate back to the code review.\n\nThe purpose of a commit message body is to describe the intent of the change and why it is necessary. Please fix the commit message body to reflect what is being added rather than listing the patchset history.\n\nThis blog post provides a pretty good explanation of how to write good commit messages in case it is helpful.\n\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/",
