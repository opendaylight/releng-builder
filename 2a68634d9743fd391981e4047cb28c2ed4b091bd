      "message": "oh, I understand now why you had that: netvirt-csit-openstack-integration...\n\njust something closer to the actual job would be good but then that is inconsistent with the above job: netvirt-csit-openstack-newton-nodl-v2-upstream-stateful-carbon\n\nso netvirt-csit-openstack-upstream-stateful? Keeping the front side the same leads me to believe the jobs are similar.\n\nStill have question about the name high-freq which is what will pop up in the releng list. Why do we need that? Why not just remove the daily upstream job and let this 4 times a day one be the job. The fact it is high-frequency doesn\u0027t add much value to have it in the name - it is still just the openstack job.",
