      "message": "So the reason this was done is it works around long job names that overflow the Linux kernel max commandline length due to extremely long shebangs which we\u0027ve run into for a few jobs.\n\nIf we don\u0027t want to do this then the alternative we\u0027ve started recommending projects do is to build their virutalenvs in /tmp/v for example:\n\nhttps://gerrit.linuxfoundation.org/infra/gitweb?p\u003dreleng/global-jjb.git;a\u003dblob;f\u003dshell/tox-install.sh;h\u003d2cffbd50cfda7440f97fc03c210800866d329c7b;hb\u003dHEAD\n\nIf this is not done then jobs that have too long a name will fail with a confusing message \"bad intepreter\".",
