      "message": "The settings provided in the Maven settings only applies for that single build step. The \"provide-maven-settings\" step creates a variable which you can use to pass to mvn\u0027s -s and -gs parameters if you are running the \"mvn\" command directly and not through the Maven build step. for example if you ran the following in a bash script:\n\nmvn clean install -s ${SETTINGS_FILE} -gs ${GLOBAL_SETTINGS_FILE}\n\n\nYour project may or may not need it if you are running some mvn commands via bash script rather than via Maven build step in Jenkins.",
