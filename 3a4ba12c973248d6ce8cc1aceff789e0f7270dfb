      "message": "Fiddle with include-raw vs include-raw-escape. My advice is to never escape brace expansion with the double {{ }} curly brace and instead use !include-raw-escape UNLESS you notice that JJB is inserting double braces into the shell when you only have single braces. In that case fall back to !include-raw. One of them always works. It\u0027s a bug in JJB IMO.",
