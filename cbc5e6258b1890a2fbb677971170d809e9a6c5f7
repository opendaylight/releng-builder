      "message": "Good point, but I think for now we don\u0027t really need netvirt to be up and working. Once/if we add some additional tests that actually require working netvirt, yes we\u0027ll need to check if it\u0027s actually up. For now, as you said, we\u0027re just doing a simple \"is the feature there and installable\" check (which seems to catch RPM failures, as test currently shows).",
