      "message": "No those loops are for copying file from the nodes, but the local.conf_* files were made locally and then scp\u0027d to the nodes, so they are still here. What I don\u0027t know is where I am in the path right now. Some how the files scp\u0027d over to here end up in the archives directory. So maybe I need to add $WORKSPACE to get the path to the original files.\n\nYes, the files are catted in the console, but I always have to go grep it, so I thought it would be cleaner if they were separate.\n\nThere is a job running: https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/sandbox/job/netvirt-csit-1node-openstack-mitaka-upstream-transparent-carbon-shague/1/",
