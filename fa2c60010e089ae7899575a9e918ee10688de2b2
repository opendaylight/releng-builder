Just leave it defaults.\n\nThe problem with keeping only a single artifact is if a 2nd build starts it deletes the artifacts so then we have 0 artifacts.\n\nI\u0027d prefer to remove the artifact[Days|Num]ToKeep and then setting the first 2 daysToKeep and numToKeep at something like 14.\n\nThis way we keep records for as long as 2 weeks and throw out everything older than that.",
