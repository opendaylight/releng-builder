The [Release Engineering project][0] consolidates the Jenkins jobs from
project-specific VMs to a single Jenkins server. Each OpenDaylight project
has a tab for their jobs on the [RelEng Jenkins server][3]. The system utilizes
[Jenkins Job Builder][7] \(JJB\) for the creation and management of the Jenkins
jobs.

Sections:

* [Jenkins Master](#jenkins_master)
* [Build Slaves](#build_slaves)
* [Creating Jenkins Jobs](#creating_jenkins_jobs)
    * [Jenkins Job Builder Installation](#jjb_install)
    * [Jenkins Job Templates](#jjb_templates)
    * [Jenkins Job Basic Configuration](#jjb_basic_configuration)
    * [Jenkins Job Maven Properties](#jjb_maven_properties)
* [Jenkins Sandbox](#jenkins_sandbox)

# <a name="jenkins_master">Jenkins Master</a>

https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/

The Jenkins Master server is the home for all project's Jenkins jobs. All
maintenance and configuration of these jobs must be done via JJB through the
[RelEng repo][4]. Project contributors can no longer edit the Jenkins jobs
directly on the server.

# <a name="build_slaves">Build Slaves</a>

The Jenkins jobs are run on build slaves (executors) which are created on an
as-needed basis. If no idle build slaves are available a new VM is brought
up. This process can take up to 2 minutes. Once the build slave has finished a
job, it will remain online for 45 minutes before shutting down. Subsequent
jobs will use an idle build slave if available.

Our Jenkins master supports many types of dynamic build slaves. If you are
creating custom jobs then you will need to have an idea of what type of slaves
are available. The following are the current slave types and descriptions.
Slave Template Names are needed for jobs that take advantage of multiple
slaves as they must be specifically called out by template name instead of
label.

## Adding New Components to the Slaves

If your project needs something added to one of the slaves used during build
and test you can help us get things added faster by doing one of the following:

* Submit a patch to releng/builder for the [Jenkins spinup script][5] that
  configures your new piece of software.

* Submit a patch to releng/builder for the [Vagrant template's bootstrap.sh][6]
  that configures your new piece of software.

Going the first route will be faster in the short term as we can inspect the
changes and make test modifications in the sandbox to verify that it works.

The second route, however, is better for the community as a whole as it will
allow others that utilize our Vagrant setups to replicate our systems more
closely. It is, however, more time consuming as an image snapshot needs to be
created based on the updated Vagrant definition before it can be attached to
the sandbox for validation testing.

In either case, the changes must be validated in the sandbox with tests to
make sure that we don't break current jobs and that the new software features
are operating as intended. Once this is done the changes will be merged and
the updates applied to the releng Jenkins production silo.

Please note that the combination of a Vagrant slave snapshot and a Jenkins
spinup script is what defines a given slave. For instance, a slave may be
defined by the [`releng/builder/vagrant/basic-java-node/`][8] Vagrant definition
and the [`releng/builder/jenkins-script/controller.sh`][9] Jenkins spinup script
(as the dynamic_controller slave is). The pair provides the full definition of
the realized slave. Jenkins starts a slave using the last-spun Vagrant snapshot
for the specified definition. Once the base Vagrant instance is online Jenkins
checks out the releng/builder repo on it and executes two scripts. The first is
[`basic_settings.sh`][10], which is a baseline for all of the slaves. The second is
the specialized spinup script, which handles any system updates, new software
installs or extra environment tweaks that don't make sense in a snapshot. After
all of these scripts have executed Jenkins will finally attach the slave as an
actual slave and start handling jobs on it.

# <a name="creating_jenkins_jobs">Creating Jenkins Jobs</a>

Jenkins Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins jobs in YAML format, and uses them to configure Jenkins.

* [Jenkins Job Builder][11] \(JJB\) documentation
* [releng/builder Gerrit][12]
* [releng/builder Git repository][13]

## <a name="jjb_install">Jenkins Job Builder Installation</a>

### Using Docker

[Docker][14] is an open platform used to create virtualized Linux containers
for shipping self-contained applications. Docker leverages LinuX Containers
\(LXC\) running on the same operating system as the host machine, whereas a
traditional VM runs an operating system over the host.

    docker pull zxiiro/jjb-docker
    docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/jjb jjb-docker

The Dockerfile that created that image is [here][15]. By default it will run:

    jenkins-jobs test .

You'll need to use the "-v" parameter to mount a directory containing your YAML
files, as well as a configured `jenkins.ini` file if you wish to upload your
jobs to the [Sandbox](#jenkins_sandbox).

### Manual install

Jenkins Jobs in the releng silo use Jenkins Job Builder, so if you need to test
your Jenkins job against the [Sandbox](#jenkins_sandbox) you will need to
install JJB.

While some OSs do package JJB, it's typically too old to work correctly with
our RelEng templates. We recommend installing from source, either master or
the most recent release. This applies for both Linux and OSX.

For example, using 1.3.0:

    $ git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder
    $ cd jenkins-job-builder
    # Stop here if you want to use master
    $ git checkout tags/1.3.0

We [recommend using virtual environments][17] to manage JJB's Python
dependencies. The tool [Virtualenv][18] can help you do so. Once you have
Virtualenv [installed][19], create a new venv for JJB and install its
dependencies, as described in its [`requirements.txt`][20].

    # From your JJB clone's root dir
    $ virtualenv jjb
    $ source jjb/bin/activate
    (jjb)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Now install JJB.

    (jjb)$ python setup.py install

Note that we're not using `sudo` to install as root, since we want to make
use of the venv we've configured for our current user.

If you have a system-level install of JJB as well, you should verify your path
is resolving to the one you expect.

    (jjb)$ command -v jenkins-jobs
    /home/daniel/jenkins-job-builder/jjb/bin/jenkins-jobs
    (jjb)$ jenkins-jobs --version
    Jenkins Job Builder version: 1.3.0

You can easily leave and return to your venv. Make sure you activate it before
each use of JJB.

    (jjb)$ deactivate
    $ command -v jenkins-jobs
    # No jenkins-jobs executable found
    $ source jjb/bin/activate
    (jjb)$ # JJB works again

Update: There was an issue with certain JJB versions. Workaround:
TODO: Is this still needed?
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/integration-dev/2015-October/005000.html

## <a name="jjb_templates">Jenkins Job Templates</a>

The OpenDaylight [RelEng/Builder][21] project provides [JJB job templates][2]
that can be used to define basic jobs.

### Verify Job Template

Trigger: **recheck**

The Verify job template creates a Gerrit Trigger job that will trigger when a
new patch is submitted to Gerrit.

Verify jobs can be retriggered in Gerrit by leaving a comment that says
**recheck**.

### Merge Job Template

Trigger: **remerge**

The Merge job template is similar to the Verify Job Template except it will
trigger once a Gerrit patch is merged into the repo. It also automatically
runs the Maven goals **source:jar** and **javadoc:jar**.

This job will upload artifacts to [OpenDaylight's Nexus][22] on completion.

Merge jobs can be retriggered in Gerrit by leaving a comment that says
**remerge**.

### Daily Job Template

The Daily (or Nightly) Job Template creates a job which will run on a build on
a Daily basis as a sanity check to ensure the build is still working day to
day.

### Sonar Job Template

Trigger: **run-sonar**

This job runs Sonar analysis and reports the results to [OpenDaylight's Sonar
dashboard][23].

**Note:** Running the "run-sonar" trigger will cause Jenkins to remove its
existing vote if it's already -1'd or +1'd a comment. You will need to re-run
your verify job (recheck) after running this to get Jenkins to re-vote.

The Sonar Job Template creates a job which will run against the master branch,
or if BRANCHES are specified in the CFG file it will create a job for the
**First** branch listed.

### Integration Job Template

The Integration Job Template creates a job which runs when a project that your
project depends on is successfully built. This job type is basically the same
as a verify job except that it triggers from other Jenkins jobs instead of via
Gerrit review updates. The dependencies that triger integration jobs are listed
in your project.cfg file under the **DEPENDENCIES** variable.

If no dependencies are listed then this job type is disabled by default.

### Patch Test Job

Trigger: **test-integration**

This job runs a full integration test suite against your patch and reports
back the results to Gerrit. Leave a comment with trigger keyword above to activate it
for a particular patch.

This job is maintained by the [Integration/Test][1] project.

**Note:** Running the "test-integration" trigger will cause Jenkins to remove
it's existing vote if it's already -1 or +1'd a comment. You will need to
re-run your verify job (recheck) after running this to get Jenkins to put back
the correct vote.

Some considerations when using this job:

* The patch test verification takes some time (~2 hours) + consumes a lot of
  resources so it is not meant to be used for every patch.
* The system tests for master patches will fail most of the times because both
  code and test are unstable during the release cycle (should be good by the
  end of the cycle).
* Because of the above, patch test results typically have to be interpreted by
  system test experts. The [Integration/Test][1] project can help with that.


## <a name="jjb_basic_configuration">Basic Job Configuration</a>

To create jobs based on the existing [templates](#jjb_templates), use the
[`jjb-init-project.py`][24] helper script. When run from the root of the
releng/builder repo, it will produce a file in jjb/\<project\>/\<project\>.yaml
containing your project's base template.

    $ python scripts/jjb-init-project.py --help
    usage: jjb-init-project.py [-h] [-c CONF] [-d DEPENDENCIES] [-t TEMPLATES]
                               [-s STREAMS] [-p POM] [-g MVN_GOALS] [-o MVN_OPTS]
                               [-a ARCHIVE_ARTIFACTS]
                               project

    positional arguments:
      project               project

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c CONF, --conf CONF  Config file
      -d DEPENDENCIES, --dependencies DEPENDENCIES
                            Project dependencies A comma-seperated (no spaces)
                            list of projects your project depends on. This is used
                            to create an integration job that will trigger when a
                            dependent project-merge job is built successfully.
                            Example: aaa,controller,yangtools
      -t TEMPLATES, --templates TEMPLATES
                            Job templates to use
      -s STREAMS, --streams STREAMS
                            Release streams to fill with default options
      -p POM, --pom POM     Path to pom.xml to use in Maven build (Default:
                            pom.xml
      -g MVN_GOALS, --mvn-goals MVN_GOALS
                            Maven Goals
      -o MVN_OPTS, --mvn-opts MVN_OPTS
                            Maven Options
      -a ARCHIVE_ARTIFACTS, --archive-artifacts ARCHIVE_ARTIFACTS
                            Comma-seperated list of patterns of artifacts to
                            archive on build completion. See:
                            http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html

If all your project requires is the basic verify, merge, and daily jobs then
using the job template should be all you need to configure for your jobs.

### Auto-Update Job Templates

The first line of the job YAML file produced by the [init script][24] will
contain the words `# REMOVE THIS LINE IF...`. Leaving this line will allow the
RelEng/Builder [auto-update script][25] to maintain this file for your project,
should the base templates ever change. It is a good idea to leave this line if
you do not plan to create any complex jobs outside of the provided template.

However, if your project needs more control over your jobs or if you have any
additional configuration outside of the standard configuration provided by the
template, then this line should be removed.

#### Tuning Templates

Allowing the auto-updated to manage your templates doesn't prevent you from
doing some configuration changes. Paramaters can be passed to templates via
a `<project>.cfg` in your `builder/jjb/<project>` directory. An example is
provided below, others can be found in the repos of other projects. Tune as
necessary. Unnecessary paramaters can be removed or commented out with a "#"
sign.

    JOB_TEMPLATES: verify,merge,sonar
    STREAMS:
    - beryllium:
        jdks: openjdk7,openjdk8
    - stable/lithium:
        jdks: openjdk7
    POM: dfapp/pom.xml
    MVN_GOALS: clean install javadoc:aggregate -DrepoBuild -Dmaven.repo.local=$WORKSPACE/.m2repo -Dorg.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.localRepository=$WORKSPACE/.m2repo
    MVN_OPTS: -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
    DEPENDENCIES: aaa,controller,yangtools
    ARCHIVE_ARTIFACTS: *.logs, *.patches

Note: [STREAMS][26] is a list of branches you want JJB to generate jobs for.
The first branch will be the branch that reports Sonar analysis. Each branch
must define a "jdks:" section listing the JDKs the verify jobs should run tests
against for the branch. The first JDK listed will be used as the default JDK
for non-verify type jobs.

#### Advanced

It is also possible to take advantage of both the auto-updater and creating
your own jobs. To do this, create a YAML file in your project's sub-directory
with any name other than \<project\>.yaml. The auto-update script will only
search for files with the name \<project\>.yaml. The normal \<project\>.yaml
file can then be left in tact with the "# REMOVE THIS LINE IF..." comment so
it will be automatically updated.

## <a name="jjb_maven_properties">Maven Properties</a>

We provide a properties which your job can take advantage of if you want to do
something different depending on the job type that is run. If you create a
profile that activates on a property listed blow. The JJB templated jobs will
be able to activate the profile during the build to run any custom code you
wish to run in your project.

    -Dmerge   : This flag is passed in our Merge job and is equivalent to the
                Maven property
                <merge>true</merge>.
    -Dsonar   : This flag is passed in our Sonar job and is equivalent to the
                Maven property
                <sonar>true</sonar>.

# <a name="jenkins_sandbox">Jenkins Sandbox</a>

[https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/sandbox](https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/sandbox/)

The Sandbox instance's purpose is to allow projects to test their JJB setups
before merging their code over to the Releng Master silo. It is configured
similarly to the Master instance above however it cannot publish or vote in
Gerrit.

If your project requires access to the Sandbox please open a Help Desk ticket
and provide us with your ODL ID.

## Notes Regarding the Sandbox

* Jobs automatically deleted Saturday @ 08:00 UTC (12:00 AM PST / 01:00 AM PDT)
* Committers can login and configure Jenkins jobs directly here (unlike on the
master silo)
* Configuration mirrors the master silo when possible
* Can NOT upload artifacts to Nexus
* Can NOT vote on Gerrit

## Using the Sandbox

Before starting using the sandbox make sure you have Jenkins Job Builder
properly installed in your setup. Refer Jenkins Job Builder Installation
section of this guide.

If you do not already have access, open a helpdesk ticket to request access to
the sandbox instance (Integration committers will have access by default).

1. Clone a copy of the releng/builder repo from https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/admin/projects/releng/builder
2. cp jenkins.ini.example jenkins.ini
3. Edit the jenkins.ini file at the root of the repo
    * Set your ODL username and password (make sure to uncomment the lines)
    * Set the URL to https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/sandbox

It is good practice to test that your JJB files are valid before pushing using
the test command. If you see no Exceptions or Failures after running the
following command your templates should be good for pushing.

The last parameter is the name of the job you want to push to Jenkins so if
your job template name is **{project}-csit-3node-periodic-{functionality}-{install}-{stream}**
you will need to expand manually the variables {project}, {functionality},
{install}, and {stream} to the exact job you want created in the Sandbox for
example **openflowplugin-csit-1node-periodic-longevity-only-beryllium**. Please
do not push ALL jobs to the Sandbox and only jobs you actually intend to test.

**Note:** the below command examples are being executed from the root of the
builder repo, and assume the "jenkins.ini" file is located there.

    jenkins-jobs --conf jenkins.ini test jjb/ <job-name>
    jenkins-jobs --conf jenkins.ini test jjb/ openflowplugin-csit-periodic-1node-cds-longevity-only-master

Expect to see an XML file describing the build job in \</maven2-moduleset\> tags
on STOUT. If you dont see any XML check that you have assigned values to the
parameters between {} in the YAML files. For example {project}

Once this is complete you can push your JJB jobs to the sandbox with the
command:

    jenkins-jobs --conf jenkins.ini update jjb/ <job-name>
    jenkins-jobs --conf jenkins.ini update jjb/ openflowplugin-csit-periodic-1node-cds-longevity-only-beryllium

**Important Note:** When pushing with jenkins-jobs command it will print out a
message similar to the one below to inform you how many jobs JJB is pushing
online. If the number is greater than 1 (or the number of jobs you passed to
the command to push) then you are pushing too many jobs and should **ctrl+c**
to cancel the upload.

    INFO:jenkins_jobs.builder:Number of jobs generated:  1

If using Docker:

    # To test
    docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/jjb zxiiro/jjb-docker

    # To upload jobs to the sandbox
    # Please ensure that you include a configured jenkins.ini in your volume mount
    docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/jjb zxiiro/jjb-docker jenkins-jobs --conf jenkins.ini update . openflowplugin-csit-periodic-1node-cds-longevity-only-master
