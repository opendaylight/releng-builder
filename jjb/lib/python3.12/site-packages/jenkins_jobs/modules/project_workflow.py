"""
Deprecated: please use :ref:`project_pipeline` instead.

The workflow Project module handles creating Jenkins workflow projects.
You may specify ``workflow`` in the ``project-type`` attribute of
the :ref:`Job` definition.
For now only inline scripts are supported.

Requires the Jenkins :jenkins-plugins:`Workflow Plugin <workflow-aggregator>`.

In order to use it for job-template you have to escape the curly braces by
doubling them in the DSL: { -> {{ , otherwise it will be interpreted by the
python str.format() command.

:Job Parameters:
    * **dsl** (`str`): The DSL content.
    * **sandbox** (`bool`): If the script should run in a sandbox (default
      false)

Job example:

    .. literalinclude::
      /../../tests/yamlparser/job_fixtures/project_workflow_template001.yaml

Job template example:

    .. literalinclude::
      /../../tests/yamlparser/job_fixtures/project_workflow_template002.yaml
