      "message": "So a situation that might occur is there might be more than 1 project that uses the same name for it\u0027s ARTIFACT_ID. For example many projects have an ARTIFACT_ID called \"distribution-karaf\". In which case we still don\u0027t know project is the cause.\n\nI think an improved solution is to:\n\n1) Run the for loop and find all pom.xml that has project.artifactId\n\n2) Check if there is only 1 pom.xml containing ARTIFACT_ID. If there is then proceed to discover the group and email their dev and release mailing lists as appropriate.\n\n3) If there is more than 1 pom.xml matching ARTIFACT_ID, then discover the groups of all matching pom.xmls and email only the release mailing list with a list of groups that have artifact IDs matching as a human will need to determine which project is failing. (Alternatively we could email all groups-dev mailing lists with matching ARTIFACT_IDs again including the full list of groups involved in hopes that they will deduplicate in the future.",
