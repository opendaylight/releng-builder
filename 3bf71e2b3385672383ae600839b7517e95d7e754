      "message": "Yes I didn\u0027t want to change the job name. Autorelease always used \"lithium\" and not \"stable-lithium\" as it\u0027s stream so I put this temporary workaround in place so that we didn\u0027t have to rename the existing job. Once we get stop building lithium we can revert this back to stream.\n\nI did as much testing as I could on the sandbox so lets merge this and see if it works in production. Thanks!",
