Not knowing why you\u0027re trying to stop selinux means that we\u0027ve got a failure to understand our system, given everything we\u0027ve been building / configuring there shouldn\u0027t be any selinux policies that are getting in the way, but if there are we need to know what they are and not ignore them.",
